CODSOFT DATA SCIENCE INTERNSHIP TASK-1

The Titanic Survival Classification project leverages Logistic Regression to predict whether passengers survived the Titanic disaster based on features like age, gender, and class. The project involved significant data cleaning to address issues such as missing values and inconsistencies. After preparing the data, the Logistic Regression model was trained to identify patterns that distinguish survivors from non-survivors, leading to predictions that can be evaluated using various performance metrics.
